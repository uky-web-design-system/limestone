# UK Style Guide in Pattern Lab

This project can be viewed at [http://patternlab.uky.edu].


## Requirements:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Mac or some other flavor of Unix that supports `fsevents`.

## Building the style guide
Clone Limestone to your local machine.

Limestone relies on Docker to build the style guide. To get Docker up and running, type:

```docker-compose up```

at the command line, in the project directory. This will start Docker and continue to run until you either a) Docker 
crashes, b) you hit `ctrl-c` to terminate Docker or c) you run `docker-compose down` in the same directory but from a different terminal window. There are other circumstances that will cause Docker to terminate (power outage, nuclear holocaust, supernovae) but the previous three are the circumstances most under your control.

The result on your terminal screen is the output from the two docker processes. Error messages will appear here, so 
you can keep it up and running in a visible location. If you don't want to watch it, you can start docker with:

```docker-compose up -d```

When you want to get the output from one of the containers, use the (docker logs)[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/] command.

## Running in Gitpod
After the workspace starts, run 2 commands to get patternlab building:

`docker-compose up`

`docker-compose exec taskrunner gulp watcher`


## Editing Patterns and Styles

Most Limestone edits will either be to "patterns," which are Twig files, or to pre-compiled assets like images, SCSS, 
and JavaScript files.

Patterns are located in `/src/_patterns`. Changes made to these files will need to be committed and then eventually 
pushed in a merge request for review.

Assets are located in, `/assets/`. Processing of assets will be handled according to their related configuration in the gulpfile.

## Configuring the Dev Environment

You will not need to configure anything in this section, this information is just to get you acquainted with the setup
 of the Limestone project.

### Gulp

You will not need to make any changes to the gulpfile.

This project's gulpfile is mounted from: `/docker/taskrunner/gulpfile.js`

### NPM / Yarn

This project's required modules are maintained with the `Yarn` package manager and listed in: 
`/docker/taskrunner/gulpfile.js`

If you need to add more modules, that is the place to do it. This should always stay mounted, since the fallback configuration may not have all the required modules.

### PatternLab
You will not need to make any changes to the PatternLab settings.

This project's PatternLab settings are in `/docker/pl/config.yml` and `/docker/pl/gulpfile.js`. 


## Drupal set up help

### Including fonts from fonts.com

Currently the fonts available in Limestone are the development fonts.  Before publishing a site using Limestone, you
 will need to contact the Web Communications Team to get the correct version of the fonts.

Including webfonts from fonts.com is almost as easy as following the instructions here: (FAQ Installing Webfonts)[https://www.fonts.com/support/faq/installwebfonts].

Downloading the .zip file from fonts.com will be an important first step.

For a Drupal install and using the faster method of ASYNC inclusion, the demo-async.css file downloaded within the Web Project .zip will need to be included as an asset to the theme info.yml file under the libraries heading. Additionally, the `mtiFontTrackingCode.js` file should also be added as a library and including in the Drupal assets. Correct paths will need to be updated within those files to tell Drupal where to find them.


### Including twig templates in Drupal

After installing the Components contributed module you can add the Limestone templates to any Drupal twig template you 
want by including something similar to the following in the info.yml file.

```yaml
component-libraries:
  components:
    paths:
      - path/to/limestone/templates
```

Similar to the twigs set up in the `_patterns/03-templates` directory, Drupal can pass variables to the included templates. For example:

```
{% include '@components/call-to-action/call-to-action.twig'
  with {
    heading: content.field_heading ? content.field_heading.0,
    text: content.field_button_text ? content.field_button_text.0,
    link: content.field_link ? content.field_link.0['#url_title'],
    color: content.field_color ? content.field_color.0['#markup'],
  }
%}
```

The `@components` piece is important to use the Components module.
